### Drones
Drones can come in many shapes. Most common we recognise them as flying helicopter like machines, but can be any type of vehicle that can perform a predefined mission without or with very little human intervention.

As the day when people walks on Mars getting closer and closer, the need for autonomous vehicles that can explore and do other tasks like moving cargo, shaping terrain, constructing base camps and so on becomes very high. On Mars such vehicles would be invaluable as they can prepare and safe an area before people arrive, but also on Earth they can increase productivity and free people for other more complex tasks.
